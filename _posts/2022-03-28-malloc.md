Memory allocated by `malloc` won't be freed after the function returns, and it will be freed when the process exits. So we can use `malloc` to allocate memory which can be used during the whole life of the program.

But when we use `malloc` in functions we should avoid this case:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void test(char* a_) {
    a_ = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char));
    *a_ = 'x';
    printf("*a_ = %c\n", *a_);
    return;
}

int main() {
    char* a = NULL;
    test(a);
    printf("*a = %c\n", *a);
    return 0;
}
```

This program will cause `segmentation fault` because when entering `test` it will copy `a` to `a_` and when `test` finishes `a_` will be released. So in function `main`, `a` is still `NULL`. The reference to `NULL` causes the `segmentation fault`.

The right way to do this is as follows.

1. Allocate in function and return the pointer.

```c
char* test(){
	char *a_ = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char));
	return p;
}
```

2. Use secondary pointer.

```c
void test(char **a_){
	*a_ = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char));
}
```
