### Rename local branch and remote branch

1. Switch to the local branch to be renamed

   ```bash
   git checkout <old-name>
   ```

2. Rename local branch

   ```bash
   git branch -m <new-name>
   ```

3. Push `<new-name>` branch to remote repository

   ```bash
   git push origin <new-name>
   ```

4. Delete `<old-name>` branch in remote repository

   ```bash
   git push origin --delete <old-name>
   ```

### View the relationship between local branch and remote branch

```bash
git branch -vv
```

### Create connection between local branch and remote branch

Checkout to the target local branch.

```bash
git push -u origin <remote-br>
```

or

```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<remote-br> <local-br>
```

After this operation, you can run `git push` and `git pull` in the branch and it will automatically communicate with `origin/<remote-br>`.
